# 🗣️ Forum-Discussions-Classification 📚

## 🔍 Overview
This repository focuses on implementing and training deep learning models for **sentiment classification** in forum discussions. By analyzing text data, these models aim to classify sentiments accurately, opening doors for applications in **natural language understanding** and **opinion mining**.

The project includes implementations of popular **neural network architectures** from scratch, offering a hands-on approach to understanding their inner workings and effectiveness in text-based tasks.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Transformer Model**: Implemented from scratch to classify sentiments in forum discussions. This model captures long-range dependencies in text, offering superior accuracy for sentiment analysis.
- **BiLSTM Model**: Built from the ground up for analyzing sequential text data. The **Bidirectional LSTM** helps capture both past and future context, improving sentiment classification.
- **Text-CNN Model**: Designed and implemented from scratch to capture sentiment-related patterns in forum discussions. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** are used for identifying key phrases and sentiment-related features in text.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch / TensorFlow
- **Text Processing**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Tokenization, Word Embeddings
- **Model Architectures**: Transformer, BiLSTM, Text-CNN
